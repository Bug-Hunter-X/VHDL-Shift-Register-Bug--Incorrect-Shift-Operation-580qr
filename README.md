This repository contains a VHDL shift register design with a bug and its corrected version. The buggy code exhibits an incorrect implementation of the shift operation, failing to perform a proper shift of bits. The solution demonstrates the correct implementation using a for loop to perform the actual shift operation.  This demonstrates a common pitfall in VHDL, where the intended behavior isn't directly reflected in the code, especially when working with vectors and signals.  The corrected code illustrates good practice in VHDL for handling bit manipulation and state update.
